# Final Year Project - Car Hire Website

I designed this project so that companies could put their office locations and the cars they have for hire onto the site and then users could find their nearest office and hire the car that they want to.

## Getting Started

Make sure that Visual Studio and SQL Server are installed then run the db creation script to create the database. Then redirect the connection string in the Variables class to your database location. Keys for Google maps and PayPal also need to be added to get full functionality. Once these have been added the project will run with all the features.

## Deployment

Publish the project to the desired url or file system.
